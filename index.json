In this paper, we evaluate DNA K-mer embeddings and the application of RNNs for genome annotation. We show how to improve the performance of our deep networks by incorporating intermediate objectives and downstream algorithms to achieve better accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"DeepAnnotator: Genome Annotation with Deep Learning","type":"publication"}]
